Udev - automation

1).First you need to create udev rule  so that when you add a pendrive a  program will be triggered
Go to ---> cd /etc/udev/rules.d
Create your rule in here
vim usbmount.rules
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd?", TAG+="systemd", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", RUN+="/usr/bin/systemctl --no-block start hemant.service"
Save this file -->filename.rules (extension .rules is must)

2).Now you need to create your service 
go to---->cd /etc/systemd/system
vim servicename.service
:[Unit]
Description=UdevTrigger
BindsTo=dev-%i.device

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/usbdevinserted.sh            (Give path of file to be executed)

3)vim /usr/bin/usbdevinserted.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash  (ADD THE SHEBANG HERE to make file executable)
python36  /root/Desktop/mail.py 
(You can write command to run your python file)

4)Make the file to be executed whose path you have given as executable
chmod +x file_path
Example :  chmod +x /usr/bin/usbdevinserted.sh 


5).As you have added a new service you need to update your daemon:
systemctl daemon-reload
udevadm control --reload 
(if you do the reboot even then the services will be updated )

Now when you will attach your pendrive ...... your script will run
